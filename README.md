# SQL-Java-Enrollment-Website-
2nd Year | 1st Term Project 



Note: As for this repository, there is some problem in git-push the original contents to the main branch as the github desktop from my end was displaying that I should publish it
even though it is already existing in the branches. I tried to git-fetch but there was not anything to be fetched for. Therefore, the new branch will reserve as the
default branch of this repository. 


This enrollment website was created through SQL and JPS in Ubuntu.
